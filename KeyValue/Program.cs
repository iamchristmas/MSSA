using System;

//Create a basic key/value store:

//    Create a struct named `KeyValue` which contains one `string` "key" and one `object` "value" as `public readonly` instance fields
//    Implement a constructor for `KeyValue` which sets the instance fields
//    Create a class named `MyDictionary` which contains one array of KeyValue structs and one `int` to keep track of the number of stored values as private instance fields.You may choose a reasonable fixed size for the array. 
//    Implement an indexer which takes a string (key) and returns an object (value).
//        The `set` property should search the array for the given key and replace the KeyValue with a `new KeyValue(...)` if it exists.If the key does not exist, it should be added as a `new KeyValue(...)`.
//        The `get` property should search the array for the given key and return the associated value if it exists.If the key does not exist, the property should throw a KeyNotFoundException.
//    Your code should compile against the following `Main` method and print a KeyNotFoundException followed by the line "42, 17" to the command line.
